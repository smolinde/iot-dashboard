This error indicates an incorrect latitude for weather location. A latitude has the following attributes:

- It is a decimal number with usually up to 7 digits
- Is is a number between -90 and 90

As this value is a number, please make sure that you do not use quotation marks as for other configuration values (e.g. `"51.163375"` will not work, `51.163375` is correct).

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
