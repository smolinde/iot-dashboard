This error may occur because of the following three reasons:
- You have entered the wrong WLAN name and/or password in the configuration file
- Your WLAN signal is too weak and/or the device is too far away from the router
- The WLAN network is not operating at 2.4GHz

To ensure that your dashboard connects to your WLAN, please make sure that all of the three reasons above are ruled out. On most modern routers you can set an intelligent dual-band operation mode (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz simultaneously). Also, it doesn't matter if the WLAN name (SSID) is broadcasted. You can very likely access your WLAN router settings by opening [this link](http://192.168.0.1) in your browser while being connected to your home network either via LAN wire or wireless, and from any device.

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
