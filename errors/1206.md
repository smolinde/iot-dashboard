This error occurs when there is something wrong with the array `station_labels` in the configuration file. Please make sure that your station labels are structured as a 3x3 array, where each row represents a station and each station has three text elements ([strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science))):

- A station icon name
- A station title
- A fuel name

The station icon name should match the file name of your custom station icon (e.g. `aral` for the file `aral.rgb666`). The station title and fuel name can be customized or left empty for default values. Please note that any station title and fuel name will be shortened to 21 characters. You can find a detailed customizing isntruction [here](../pages/user-manual.md#245-station_labels).

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
