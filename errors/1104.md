This error occurs in case the program finds more than three custom station icons stored on your SD card in the `station_icons` folder. This error prevents performance issues on the dashboard. The dashboard never displays more than three station icons. If there were more icons, the program would have to verify their size and this could consume a substantial amount of time. Therefore, please make sure that the folder `station_icons` contains three or less custom station icon files.
