This error occurs when custom station icons were added to the SD card and are not meeting the dimensional requirements. When downloading or creating a PNG, please make sure that you resize it afterwards down (or up) to 64 x 64 pixels. To resize a PNG image, I strongly recommend using [this website](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-png#resize-options,pixels). It is free of charge. After resizing the image, run the [conversion script](../scripts/png_to_rgb666.py) and copy the resulting `.rgb666` file to the `station_icons` directory on your SD card. For convenience, make sure that the file name equals the station brand (e.g. the ARAL logo would be `aral.rgb666`). You have to use the station icon file names in the [configuration.json](../sdcard/configuration.json) file, in the first lines of the `station_labels` arrays to be displayed. It is recommended to follow [these steps]() to ensure your custom gas station icons are accepted and displayed as expected.
