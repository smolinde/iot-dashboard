This error occurs if either one or more station ID's that you provided in the configuration file are duplicated. The intent of the dashboard is to compare different fuel prices. Therefore, using the same station ID multiple times is prohibited. Please make sure to use three different station ID's.

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
