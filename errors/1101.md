This error appears if there is no SD card inserted into the dashboard or the SD card is not formatted as a FAT32 file system. Please check whether the SD card is inserted properly and please make sure that the SD card has the correct file system format. The SD card that comes with the dashboard has already the correct file system format. This could happen if you use your own SD card that has a different format (e.g. NTFS or exFAT). Further details on how to format the SD card can be found [here](../pages/user-manual.md#21-sd-card-setup).

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
