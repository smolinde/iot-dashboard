This error indicates an incorrect longitude for weather location. A longitude has the following attributes:

- It is a decimal number with usually up to 7 digits
- Is is a number between -180 and 180

As this value is a number, please make sure that you do not use quotation marks as for other configuration values (e.g. `"10.447683"` will not work, `10.447683` is correct).

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
