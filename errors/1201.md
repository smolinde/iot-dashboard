This error occurred because the WLAN name that you provided in the configuration file is invalid, most likely because of one of the following three reasons:

* A WLAN name has a maximum length of 32
* A WLAN name may contain any [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters, but cannot be empty or contain only spaces
* A WLAN name must be a text element ([string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)))

Please make sure that your WLAN name is inside of double quotation marks (e.g. "MySecureWLAN") and fulfills all of the previously mentioned aspects.
