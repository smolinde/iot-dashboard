This error occurred because the WLAN password that you provided in the configuration file is invalid, most likely because of one of the following three reasons:

* A WLAN password must have a length between 8 and 63
* A WLAN password may contain any [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters, but cannot be empty or contain only spaces
* A WLAN password must be a text element ([string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)))

Please make sure that your WLAN password is inside of double quotation marks (e.g. "MySecureWLANPassword") and fulfills all of the previously mentioned aspects.
