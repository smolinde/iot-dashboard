This error occurs if the fuel type is not one of the following three values:

- `e5` for regular gas (E5)
- `e10` for gas with bioethanol (E10)
- `diesel` for diesel fuel (B7/B10/XTL)

Please make sure to set one of these three values. Also note that not all stations have all types of fuel available, which means that for some stations and fuel types the price will be always displayed as `-,--`.

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
