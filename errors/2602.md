This error prevents your dashboard from installing malicious or corrupted firmware updates. There is no action needed, and the device will retry to download and update the firmware in 24 hours again. 

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
