This error occurs if the Tankerkoenig API key that you provided in the configuration file is invalid. Please make sure that the API key has the following format:  

`XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`  

Where an X can be either a number from 0 to 9 or a letter from a to f. Please note that providing the correct format does not guarantee that the dashboard will display any gas prices or station statuses. You must obtain your own API key [here](https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de) for free. Further information on how to obtain an API key can be found [here]().  

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
