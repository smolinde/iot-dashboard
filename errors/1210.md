This error occurs if the auto-update flag `automatic_updates` is not set to either `true` or `false`. Please not that the values should be written without quotation marks (e.g. `"true"` will not work, `true` is correct). Also, it is strongly recommended to keep the auto-updates by leaving the value `true`. This way your dashboard will always stay up-to-date and get better with time without the necessity to do anything. All updates are managed over this repository and your device.

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
