This error occurs when the dashboard detects a firmware update, but something goes wrong while downloading the update file. A reason for this could be a temporary issue, a GitHub server outage, instable internet and/or WLAN connection, or too many simultaneous update requests. There is no action needed, and the device will retry to download and update the firmware in 24 hours again. 

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
