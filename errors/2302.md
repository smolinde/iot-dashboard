# Error 2302 - Connection to WLAN Lost

This error may occur because of the following three reasons:
- Your WLAN signal is too weak and/or the device is too far away from the router
- The WLAN was turned off
- A temporary issue (interference with another wireless device)

The dashboard will attempt to reconnect on its own. If this issue occurs frequently, try to reposition your dashboard closer to the router and see if this resolves the problem. Also make sure that your router has a stable power supply.

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
