This error occurs if your device was not able to synchronize its internal clock with [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time). A reason for this could be a temporary issue, server outage, or high demand for time synchronization. The time synchronization is essential for the dashboard to operate correctly. There is no action needed, and the device will restart and try to synchronize again. The synchronization happens hourly. 

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
