In case this error appeared, your configuration file contains (or is missing) something that causes the JSON parser to throw an error. Please make sure that the structure of the file is exact like in this [configuration.json](../sdcard/configuration.json). You can find a detailed instruction on how to fill the configuration file [here](../pages/user-manual.md#2-dashboard-configuration).

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
