This error occurs if your device is connected to your WLAN, but cannot reach the internet. Please check for local internet outages via [Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/). In case all of your other devices appear to be offline, please contact your internet provider for further assistance. Also make sure that your WLAN router is not connected to a VPN service. If connected, try to turn the VPN off to see if this resolves the issue.

If this page still did not resolve the problem, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/smolinde/iot-dashboard/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). The project maintainer will try to respond to it as soon as possible.
